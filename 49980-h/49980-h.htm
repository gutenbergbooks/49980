<h1 title="">HISTORICAL GUIDE TO OLD CHARLOTTESVILLE
<br />WITH MENTION OF ITS STATUES AND OF
<br />ALBEMARLE&rsquo;S SHRINES</h1>
<p>Upon the forming of the County of Albemarle in 1745, its
boundaries included what are now Buckingham, Amherst,
Nelson, and Fluvanna Counties, with parts of Appomattox and
Campbell&mdash;the Blue Ridge being the Western line. The county
seat was then placed in Scottsville on the James, but with final
boundary adjustments in 1761 it was felt necessary to remove
the court house to a more central site. Thus Charlottesville
was not a town of natural growth, but a political creation.
It was formed by Act of Assembly, November 5th, 1761, to
take effect January 1st, 1762. The name was bestowed in honor
of Princess Charlotte, bride of George III.</p>
<p>The Court House Square was owned by the County, and
adjoined the town on the North. A court house was erected
promptly, but for some years town growth was slow, and as
late as 1779 the village was said to contain only about a dozen
houses. In 1835 it consisted of &ldquo;about 200 handsome and comfortable
dwellings, generally of brick, 4 houses of worship, 3
large hotels, 1 tavern, 2 book stores, 2 druggist stores, and
about 20 mercantile establishments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The court house and its environs now constitute Old Charlottesville,
and some account of the locality will be found in the
ensuing pages.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small">ALBEMARLE COUNTY COURT HOUSE</span></h2>
<p>The first Charlottesville Court House, built in 1762, was of
wood, and reproduced that of Henrico County; the cost 375
pounds, ten shillings. It stood near the site of the Confederate
statue and faced down Court&mdash;now Fifth&mdash;Street.</p>
<p>In that small structure both Jefferson and Monroe, as
fledgling lawyers, practiced that profession. Both were youthful
magistrates&mdash;although public life early broke this tie for
both of them. There are no records of Mr. Jefferson&rsquo;s sitting
on the bench, although he did take depositions. Mr. Monroe sat
regularly for six months in 1799, just previous to becoming
Governor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h3 id="c2">TARLETON AND JACK JOUETT.</h3>
<p>As the Revolutionary War drew to its end the little building
knew a brief notoriety. Before the threat of Cornwallis,
Governor Jefferson and the Legislature refugeed, May 24,
1781, to re-convene in Charlottesville. The Legislature met in
the Court House, the overflow occupying the Swan Tavern
across the street. Cornwallis dispatched in pursuit his &ldquo;hunting
leopard,&rdquo; Col. Banastre Tarleton, with a troup of 180 cavalry
and 70 mounted infantry.</p>
<p>These reached the village on the morning of June 4th, to
find that a warning had preceded them. The members had left
town for Staunton: they were pursued and seven captured.
The Jeffersons&mdash;the family by carriage, Mr. Jefferson on horseback&mdash;refugeed
to Enniscorthy, the Coles plantation in Southern
Albemarle.</p>
<p>The warning was brought by John Jouett, captain of militia,
and a native of Charlottesville, his father being the owner
of Swan Tavern. Chancing to be in Cuckoo Tavern in Louisa
County as the legion swept by on the main road, he suspected
their destination and rode swiftly by a shorter route, covering
the forty-odd miles in time to arrive several hours before the
enemy. This was the famous &ldquo;Jack Jouett&rsquo;s Ride,&rdquo; which in
dash, and political importance, surpassed that of New England&rsquo;s
Paul Revere.</p>
<p>In Charlottesville the British troops destroyed military
stores amounting to 1000 new muskets, 400 barrels of powder,
several hogsheads of tobacco, and a quantity of soldiers&rsquo; clothing.
A more serious loss was the burning on the court house
green of the County records, which covered the foundation of
the County. As the uniform of the legion was white, faced with
green, and that of the infantry red, the village must have presented
a dramatic appearance during these hours.</p>
<p>Upon the 5th, Tarleton with his prisoners, withdrew towards
Tidewater, his movements being hastened by rains
which flooded the streams, and by the gathering of local
militia. Jouett&rsquo;s gallant action received State recognition. A
resolution of the General Assembly, December 14, 1786, reads:
Colonel Meriwether directed, &ldquo;to procure an elegant sword for
Capt. John Jouett on the best terms he can for the Contingent
Warrents.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h3 id="c3">PRESENT COURT HOUSE BUILDING</h3>
<p>The main portion of the present court house was built by
order of court, 1803. A committee of three produced the plan.
(Mr. Jefferson was not one of these, but is said to have approved
the design.) We do not know the style of the original
portico; the present entrance and T-front are post-Civil War.
The grounds held the usual whipping post, stocks, and pillory,
and as late as 1857 the whipping post was restored.</p>
<p>The court house long served as the town&rsquo;s public building,
and the denominations used it in rotation. Writing about this
in 1822, Mr. Jefferson says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In our Richmond there is much fanaticism, but chiefly
among the women. In our village of Charlottesville there
is a good degree of religion, with but a small spice of fanaticism.
We have four sects, but without either a church
or a meeting house. The court house is the common temple,
one Sunday in the month to each. Here Episcopal and
Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptist, meet together, join
in hymning their maker, listen with attention to each
others&rsquo; preachers, and all mix in society in perfect harmony.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Jefferson was a frequent worshipper, riding down
from Monticello and bringing a light cane which opened into
a seat&mdash;his own invention. It was not unusual to see on this
green a president and two ex-presidents in friendly talk with
neighbors. Mr. Madison, who lived some twenty-odd miles off
in Orange County, was a close friend of the Albemarle two:
they were called &ldquo;the great trio,&rdquo; as in close harmony they
governed the United States for some twenty-four years. Mr.
Madison was a member of the University Board, and, oddly
enough, president of the Albemarle Agriculture Society.</p>
<p>An interesting old document, originally deposited in the
court house was the will of Thaddeus Kosciusko, the gallant
Pole who came to America to fight in the Revolution. He left
it with Mr. Jefferson, and appointed him executor. When
Jefferson heard of his death in 1817 he had the will recorded
in the office of the Albemarle Circuit Court, where it remained
on file until May, 1857. It was then transmitted to the Secretary
of the Commonwealth, to be deposited in the State Library.</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferson&rsquo;s own will, executed here, contained many
interesting and touching features. Although overwhelmed
with debts, he freed five of his servants. This portion reads
as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h3 id="c4">JEFFERSON&rsquo;S WILL</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I give to my good, affectionate, and faithful servant,
Burwell, his freedom and the sum of three hundred dollars
to buy the necessaries to commence his trade of
painter and glazier, or to use otherwise as he pleases. I
give also to my good servants, John Hemings and Joe
Fosset, their freedom at the end of one year after my
death, and to each of them respectively, all of the tools of
their respective shops or callings, and it is my will that a
comfortable log house be built for each of the three servants
so emancipated, on some part of my lands convenient
to them with respect to the residence of their
wives, and to Charlottesville and the University, where
they will mostly be employed.&mdash;I give the use of an acre
of land to each during his life.&mdash;I humbly and earnestly
request of the legislature of Virginia a confirmation of
the bequest of freedom to these servants with permission
to remain in this State where their families and connections
are, as an additional instance of favor, of which I
have received so many manifestations in the course of my
life, and for which I now give them my last solemn and
dutiful thanks.&rdquo; (Two boys were to receive their freedom
upon coming of age.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c5">COURT HOUSE VOTING</h3>
<p>Until towards the middle of the 1800&rsquo;s this court house was
the sole voting place in Albemarle County. Elections were held
on court days. Only &ldquo;Freeholders&rdquo;&mdash;white, adult males owning
at least twenty-five acres of land with a building on it&mdash;had
the franchise. The secret ballot was unknown. Candidates were
required to be present throughout the election, and by popular
custom they were expected to furnish a &ldquo;treat&rdquo; for their followers.
These supplies of food, and especially of drink, became
an expense which friends sometimes had to share. Rum punch
was the usual drink, although cider was also offered.</p>
<p>The procedure was as follows: the voting was by voice. A
long table was placed in the court room. At the center of this
sat the High Sheriff; on either side of him were a few of the
county Justices; then at the two extreme ends were the respective
candidates, each with a clerk who recorded his party&rsquo;s
votes. The room was open to the crowd. Singly, each voter advanced
before the bench. If unchallenged, the Sheriff asked his
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
choice and the man named his candidate. The candidate then
usually rose, bowed, and expressed his thanks: &ldquo;I thank you,
Sir&rdquo;; &ldquo;You honor me, Sir.&rdquo; The crowd at the same time expressed
its feelings in cheers or sharp retorts. (<i>See The Freeholder,
Charles S. Sydnor, Chapel Hill Press.</i>)</p>
<p>It is interesting to know that Jefferson and Monroe both
voted in such elections many times. This method continued
until after the death of both men.</p>
<p>On one occasion, April 1810, Mr. Jefferson came down hurriedly
from Monticello and lobbied on this green for Monroe,
who at that time was undergoing a brief decline in popular
favor. The contest was for the State Assembly. The local party
had gone so far as to decide to nominate another man; Mr.
Jefferson&rsquo;s intervention, however, nipped this in the bud; the
proposed candidate withdrew at Jefferson&rsquo;s solicitation; Monroe
was substituted and elected.</p>
<h3 id="c6">JOHN S. MOSBY.</h3>
<p>Coming momentarily down to the War-Between-the-States
era, Virginia&rsquo;s famous cavalry officer, Col. John S. Mosby, is
doubly connected with this building. Mosby came to Albemarle
as a small boy, grew up near town, and attended the University.
While a student, he&mdash;in an altercation&mdash;shot and seriously
wounded a man. He was tried in this building and sentenced to
a year in prison; but he was pardoned after serving seven
months.</p>
<p>During the war, as &ldquo;Ranger Mosby,&rdquo; he had a brilliant
guerrilla career. In March, 1865, about a month before the
surrender, he happened to be in Charlottesville at the time of
Sheridan&rsquo;s raid through the town. He was warned that Sheridan
would enter from the West. He obtained civilian dress.
Believing he had time, he entered a Main Street shop. However,
the Union troops had spread out and a small company
was entering from the North, down Park Street, at that very
time. A running colored boy warned Mosby of his danger;
hearing the words &lsquo;Park Street,&rsquo; he supposed he was to escape
in that direction. Rushing for his horse, he entered Fifth Street
on the dead run. Reaching Jefferson Street he found the company
was already at the court house and disbanding. Dashing
through unrecognized he cleared High Street at one jump, &lsquo;with
mud splashing to Heaven,&rsquo; and escaped down Park Street after
all.</p>

<p class="cap">Sixth Street. Eastern Boundary of Village. <span class="hst"><i>J. Rawlings Thomson</i></span></p></div>
<h2 id="c7"><br /><span class="small">BUILDINGS ON THE SQUARE</span></h2>
<h3 id="c8">TOWN HALL</h3>
<p>These old, early nineteenth-century houses have a grave and
quaint charm of their own. At the corner of Park and East
High Streets stands a large red brick building now known as
the Park View Apartment, 350 Park Street. It was erected in
1851 &ldquo;for the purpose of a town Hall.&rdquo; Up to that time the lot
had served as a playground for men and boys, and was known
as the Battery. Later, the hall became the Levy Opera House,
but with the coming of the movies its public functions declined.</p>
<h3 id="c9">SWAN TAVERN</h3>
<p>The Red Land Club now occupies the site of one of the old
buildings of the village, the famous Swan Tavern. The exact
date of the tavern&rsquo;s building is not known; the lot was bought
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
in 1773. The building was a wooden structure with its painted
sign of a swan hanging over the door. It was the home of the
Jouett family. Jack Jouett, hero of the famous ride, lived here,
and here the refugeeing members of the Virginia Legislature
convened in 1781. In 1812 the tavern became known as the War
Office, as military matters connected with that war were
handled here. Following this, it gradually fell into decay and
in 1832 collapsed. The present brick building was then erected.</p>
<h3 id="c10">SLAVE TRADE</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/img005.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="418" />
<p class="cap">Farish House. Now Old Wing of Monticello Hotel. <span class="hst"><i>J. Rawlings Thomson</i></span></p></div>
<p>Number Nothing (now Numbers 240-242 Court Square) is
the original house on this lot. It was built in 1820; a double
store, separately owned and handled. The name comes from
the fact that at first the lot was intended for a horse lot. When
it was sold the other lots had been numbered in rotation; a
sequence was impossible, so Number Nothing was chosen.
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Traditions of the slave trade cluster here. Until some forty
years ago there was on its Southern side, at the curb, a large
stone, some eighteen inches high, by fifteen inches wide, and
thirty long, which was known as the slave block. Here the village
auctioneers long functioned, and doubtless when slaves
were brought in, their dealers made use of these facilities.
A fragment of an old sign may still be deciphered on this wall:
&ldquo;... and Bros. Auction Rooms.&rdquo; The stone was unintentionally
removed during recent street repairs.</p>
<h3 id="c11">VILLAGE LIBRARY</h3>
<p>223 Court Square was built in 1815 as a store. Next, where
Number 222 now stands, formerly stood two small wooden
buildings. The first was a small, one-room affair, the village
library. Mr. Jefferson made substantial contributions of books
from his great collection. A few of these volumes, bearing both
his signature and the stamp of the library, are preserved in
the Alderman Library at the University.</p>
<h3 id="c12">SWISS WATCH-MAKER</h3>
<p>The second little house was the shop of a Swiss watch-maker,
who was induced to settle here by Mr. Jefferson, who
at intervals brought in other European artisans: Italians to
introduce wine-making, an Italian coach-builder, and stone-cutters
to carve the capitols at the University.</p>
<h3 id="c13">EAGLE TAVERN</h3>
<p>On the Square&rsquo;s South side stood the famous Eagle Tavern.
Its site is now the East wing of the Monticello Hotel. For almost
two centuries this spot has been the site of a house of
entertainment, and has never had any other use.</p>
<p>The date of the first building is not recorded. The lot was
cut off and sold in 1765; the village then was two years old,
and the lot was new. When sold for the second time, in 1791,
it is described as a tavern. The building probably followed the
first purchase.</p>
<p>The Eagle Tavern was a wooden, two-and-a-half story
building, with the sign of the eagle displayed. A deep porch covered
its front, and on this travelling peddlers habitually sold
their goods: saddles, boots, dry goods, etc. This for some
decades was an important item in the supplies of the village,
but after 1835-36 it died away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Later, this wooden structure was replaced by the present low
brick building. The name became Eagle Hotel, and so continued
until 1863, when it became the Farish House.</p>
<p>Of its use before the coming of the railways we are told
that on court days 200 or more persons dined here, and in the
stables and lot 250 horses were fed. Reminiscing, an early citizen
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In 1833 the price of board and lodging was ten dollars
per month. The public room was a spacious hall, having
in it a large open fireplace.... In one corner of this public
room was the bar, having shelves on which were ranged
decanters and bottles of the ardent&mdash;the elixir of life....
Our farmers sat down to a superb dinner, and cheerfully
paid the landlord fifty cents for it&mdash;not as in the present
times, when many bring snacks in their pockets and eat
them while sitting at a fire kept up by the landlord for
the guests of the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As late as the 1790&rsquo;s public dances were given here, and
were attended by high and low, the different classes keeping to
themselves, though without friction. (This mingling was doubtless
due to the scarcity of music.) Here, too, the political parties
celebrated their victories with great dinners, and endless
speeches and toasts.</p>
<p>An old book gives this somewhat disconcerting glimpse of
the village in 1818:</p>
<h3 id="c14">&ldquo;SATAN&rsquo;S THUMB&rdquo;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In passing through the place in 1818, Dr. Conrad Speece
attempted to preach at night in the court house, but nearly
failed, due to the insufficient light, and the rudeness of
the boys. He spent the night at the tavern, and such were
the sentiments uttered by the prominent gentlemen, and
such the conduct of the young men frequenting the tavern,
that he said the next day: &ldquo;When Satan promised all the
kingdoms of the world to Christ, he laid his thumb on
Charlottesville, and whispered, &lsquo;<i>except this place, which
I reserve for my own especial use</i>&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This old hostelry in its day housed all the great men of the
vicinity, and a great many from a distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br /><span class="small">CIVIL WAR PERIOD</span></h2>
<h3 id="c16">SHERIDAN&rsquo;S RAID</h3>
<p>Charlottesville was occupied by Sheridan&rsquo;s Cavalry, U.S.A.,
arriving March 3rd, 1865, and leaving on the 6th. Their entry
was from the West, and troops encamped in many sections of
the town: &ldquo;above the University,&rdquo; South of the University
(Piedmont), Belmont, Park Street, what is now Locust Grove,
etc.</p>
<p>A committee from the University secured guards for that
institution and it was uninjured. There was no burning in the
town with the exception of the Woolen Mills, East Market
Street, which had furnished material for Confederate uniforms.
All approaching bridges were destroyed. Searching
homes for hidden arms was almost universal, and there was
considerable looting, followed in some instances by mobs of
negroes and disorderly whites. A detailed, edited letter in the
<i>Magazine of Albemarle County History, Vol. 14</i>, gives the following
information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As a general thing the citizens suffered little. Parties
were sent out in all directions, and did an immense amount
of damage. Our country friends suffered dreadfully. Corn,
meat, flour, hay, horses, and negroes were in great demand....
I suppose the County has lost many hundred
horses, and from 1500 to 2000 negroes. Some families lost
almost everything they had, their household stuff being
taken away or destroyed.... Hundreds of watches must
have been carried out of the County. Poor Mrs. Harper
(Farmington) not only lost in servants and horses, but
had her house ransacked from garrett to cellar.... Her
pictures were spared, her wines, of course, all taken....
I told my servants they had my full consent to go, ... but
none of mine left.&rdquo; (Quartered in his home, 713 Park
Street, were Col. Battersby, 1st N. Y. Lincoln Cavalry, his
Hungarian orderly, and a negro servant.) &ldquo;He and his
orderly appeared to be perfect gentlemen and conducted
themselves in all respects as our guests.&rdquo; He furnished
guards for two neighbors. &ldquo;Col. Battersby had a fine Newfoundland
dog.... He returned to my house the day after
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
his master left, and is now with me. I have written to Col.
Battersby and sent my letter to Richmond to go by flag of
truce.&rdquo; Family tradition states that shortly after Appomattox
the orderly came for the dog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Col. Sheridan&rsquo;s headquarters were successively No. 408 and
No. 522 Park St. Major-General Wesley E. Merritt was quartered
at 303 East High Street, and Major-General George A.
Custer at The Farm&mdash;the beautiful house designed by Jefferson,
now 1201 East Jefferson Street. It was at the time the
home of Capt. Thomas L. Farish, C.S.A.</p>
<h3 id="c17">ESCAPE FROM GALLOWS</h3>
<p>Capt. Farish was on Adjutant-General duty in South-side
Virginia. He obtained leave to return to Albemarle for the protection
of his family. He was captured in civilian dress and
taken to the custody of Gen. Custer&mdash;in Farish&rsquo;s own home.
Receiving him, Custer said, &ldquo;Capt. Farish, in these unusual
circumstances, I don&rsquo;t know whether it is my duty to ask you
to take a seat or yours to ask me.&rdquo; The civilian dress classed
Farish as a spy, and Sheridan sentenced him to death by hanging.
Workmen erected a scaffold beneath one of the giant white
oaks on Farish&rsquo;s lawn. Custer made persistent remonstrance,
and in a discussion which lasted until midnight, obtained a
change of sentence to parole. (See Farish&rsquo;s narrative, <i>Weekly
Chronicle, Charlottesville, August 4, 1876</i>&mdash;<i>Alderman Library</i>.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br /><span class="small">MILITARY OCCUPATION</span></h2>
<p>At the close of the war the country was under military government.
The civil courts were closed, right of public assembly
denied, and the usual further restrictions. Government headquarters
were in Richmond, and Military Commissioners controlled
the separate counties under direction from the central
offices. This occupation continued for two years. Albemarle
was fortunate in the character of the U. S. Army officers who
filled this difficult role. On the first of these&mdash;Captain Linn
Tidball&mdash;several anecdotes remain. He was strict with the
populace, but also with his soldiers, and more than once disciplined
them for &ldquo;unnecessary harshness in the discharge of
duty.&rdquo; One small incident was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of soldiers stationed at the Farish house (now
the old wing of the Monticello Hotel), for a while amused
themselves hanging out a Union flag so that it impeded
the sidewalk before the building. They would then force
all passers-by to halt and salute. War feeling was still too
high for this to be accepted; the populace boycotted that
walk and passed in single file down the middle of the
street, with eyes straight ahead. After a few days this
came to the attention of the officer. The flag was removed
and the men reproved, on the grounds that to use the flag
for purposes of malice or sport was degrading to its
honor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One regulation was that Confederate uniforms might not
be worn in public. This worked much hardship on the
newly-returned soldiers, who had no other clothing and
no means of procuring any. A committee waited on the
Commissioner and requested some modification. His order
was that all military buttons and insignia be removed from
the coats, and the grey could then be used until it could
be replaced. Some time later a young mountaineer was
brought before him. The youth, in Confederate uniform,
had fought in the streets with Union soldiers. When these
soldiers had testified, the officer asked for the young man&rsquo;s
statement. He said he had never heard of any regulations
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
about his uniform. He was walking along and a soldier
halted him and began to roughly cut off his buttons. &ldquo;I
thought he wanted them for his girl back home, and I
knocked him down. Then them other fellows come up and
they got <i>me</i> down.&rdquo; The officer called for the severed buttons,
gave them to the youth and said: &ldquo;Take these home
and give them to <i>your</i> girl. She may want to keep them.
Have her sew plain buttons on your jacket, and in future,
young man, don&rsquo;t be so handy with your fists.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, this officer showed exceptional confidence in the community.
A distressing problem for the county was to provide
for the returned men who lacked the essentials for resuming
work and a normal life. A committee of three prominent men,
headed by Col. Thomas Jefferson Randolph, grandson of Jefferson,
visited the officer and asked permission to hold a public
meeting for discussion of the situation. Col. Randolph stated
that the committee would be personally responsible for the
good conduct of the crowd, and would vouch for the propriety
of all speeches. The officer not only gave his consent&mdash;he
stated he would allow it to take place without guards. The
meeting was held in the old Levy Opera House, now the Park
View Apts., on the corner of Park and East High Streets. The
contract was strictly observed on both sides.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the sectional adjustment achieved
in only a decade. On July 21, 1876, Memorial Services commemorating
the first battle of Manassas were held in Charlottesville
by the 19th Virginia Regiment. Tents were pitched
in the court house yard, and banners stretched across the
streets inscribed with appropriate mottoes. At the banquet,
one toast was: &ldquo;The American Union.&rdquo; Col. R. T. W. Duke,
C.S.A., responded, &ldquo;May it endure for all time.&rdquo; See <i>Charlottesville
Chronicle, July 28, 1876</i>. <i>Alderman Library, University
of Virginia.</i></p>

<h3 id="c20">MONTICELLO
<br /><i>Monticello Mt.</i></h3>
<p>The home of Thomas Jefferson, designed and built by himself
upon land inherited from his father&mdash;Colonel Peter Jefferson,
member of the House of Burgesses and Lieutenant-Colonel
of the County. The leveling of the mountain top began, 1768.
Due to successive additions and alterations, completion of the
buildings was later than 1809. Following the burning of Shadwell,
his father&rsquo;s home, Jefferson moved to Monticello (the
Southwest Out Chamber) in 1771 and in 1772 brought his
bride there. She was Martha Wayles Skelton, a young widow
of twenty-three, distinguished for beauty and a graceful carriage.
It was an exceptionally happy marriage, ended after
ten years by her death. Of six children, only two daughters
survived infancy. Both left descendants.</p>
<p>In 1781 Monticello was raided by British Tarleton&rsquo;s troops,
in pursuit of the refugeeing Governor and Legislature. Forewarned,
the family escaped. There was no property damage.
Upon his visit to America in 1824, Lafayette was a guest here,
and a great public reception in his honor was held on the lawn.</p>
<p>Monticello remained Jefferson&rsquo;s much loved home until his
death there, July 4, 1826, aged eighty-three. Due to financial
stress, it was sold in 1830 for $7,000. In 1836 it was purchased
by Commodore Uriah P. Levy of the United States
Navy for $2,700. With the exception of the Civil War period,
when it was confiscated by the Confederate Government, it remained
in the Levy family until sold to the Monticello Memorial
Foundation, 1923. Much of the original furniture and
many personal relics are on display.</p>
<h3 id="c21">ASH LAWN
<br /><i>2 mi. beyond Monticello</i></h3>
<p>Home of James Monroe, twice Governor of Virginia, U. S.
Senator, Secretary of State and War, Minister to France and
to England, and twice President of the United States. James
Monroe was born in 1758 at his father&rsquo;s home, Monroe&rsquo;s Creek,
Westmoreland County, Virginia. He studied at Williamsburg,
served with distinction in the Revolutionary War, and practiced
law for eighteen months in Fredericksburg. His removal
to Albemarle was the fulfillment of a long-cherished plan, as
his pleasant letters to Mr. Jefferson show. One reads as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>

<blockquote>
<p>August 19, 1786. &ldquo;I shall leave this (N.Y.) for Virginia.
I have not relinquished the prospect of being your neighbor....
The house for which I have requested a plan may
possibly be erected near Monticello. To fix there and to
have yourself in particular, with what friends we may
collect around for society, is my chief object, or rather
the only one which promises to me ... real and substantial
pleasure.&rdquo; <i>Writings of James Monroe, Stanislaus
Murray, Hamilton, Vol. I, p. 158.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Jefferson&rsquo;s reply is also pleasant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To Colonel Monroe
from Jefferson, December 18, 1786. Paris. When I return,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
which will be early in the Spring, I shall send you ... the
plan of your house. I wish to heaven you may continue in
the disposition to fix it in Albemarle. Short (Washington&rsquo;s
Minister to Holland) will establish himself there,
and perhaps Madison may be tempted to do so. This will
be society enough, and it will be the great sweetener of
our lives.&rdquo; <i>Papers of Thos. Jefferson, edited by T. J.
Randolph, Vol. II, p. 69.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In August, 1789, Monroe removed to his first Albemarle
purchase&mdash;an 800-acre farm just west of Charlottesville. A
portion of this tract is now included in the site of the University
of Virginia, and known as Monroe Hill. This farm
proved a disappointment, and in 1793 he bought the Carter
tract. This adjoined Monticello on the north and William
Short&rsquo;s estate&mdash;then Indian Camp, now Morven&mdash;on the south.
Monroe named his new home Highland, but by later changes
of ownership it became North Blenheim and then Ash Lawn.</p>
<h3 id="c22">BUILDING OF ASH LAWN</h3>
<p>Due to Monroe&rsquo;s prolonged absences&mdash;Washington, France,
England&mdash;the development of the estate was delayed. Jefferson,
and Monroe&rsquo;s uncle, Joseph Jones, Chief Justice of Virginia,
had oversight of planning and building. The exact date
of the moving in is given in a letter from Monroe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;November
22, 1799. I was yesterday at Monticello, where Mr. Jefferson
informed me he proposed a visit to you ... I told him
it would ... immediately appear throughout the nation.
He declined the trip ... in the persuasion an interview
might be had, by your making me a visit, in my new
home, to which I move tomorrow.&rdquo; <i>Writings, Vol. III,
p. 158.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c23">SALE OF ASH LAWN</h3>
<p>As is well known, Monroe&rsquo;s life was straitened by debt.
Under this pressure, he wrote to Jefferson as early as 1814 of
a plan to sell either his Loudon estate or that in Albemarle,
adding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;intending however, not to sell that in Albemarle unless
the price be such as to indemnify me for the sacrifice I
shall make in relinquishing a residence of 26 years&rsquo; standing,
as mine has been, and near old friends to whom I am
greatly attached.&rdquo; <i>Writings, Vol. V, p. 287.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sale finally took place, January 1st, 1826, the price
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
being $18,140. The Monroes then resided at Oak Hill in
Loudon County. In 1828 Mr. Monroe removed to New York
City, where his death occurred, July 4th, 1831. His body was
re-interred at Richmond, Virginia, July 5th, 1858.</p>
<h3 id="c24">BOXWOOD GARDEN AND STATUE</h3>
<p>Ash Lawn&rsquo;s widely known boxwood garden is held, by
local tradition, to have been designed by a French landscape
artist who during Monroe&rsquo;s presidency was engaged in work
for Washington City. Certainly the old formal planting and
the size of the slow-growing dwarf box (suffruticosa) do not
clash with this belief.</p>
<p>The garden now is dominated by a marble statue of Monroe.
This was presented to the president&rsquo;s home upon the hundredth
anniversary of his death, by the sculptor Attilio Piccirilli,
whose work may be also seen in the capitol in Richmond
and the Metropolitan Museum in New York.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h3 id="c25">THE MICHIE TAVERN
<br /><i>Rt. 53, Monticello Road</i></h3>
<p>This authentic eighteenth century tavern was moved, 1927,
from its original site on the Buck Mountain Road in North
Albemarle to its present location on Monticello Road. Before-and-after
photographs show that while some later tamperings
were done away with, the original structure was scrupulously
preserved&mdash;with the exception of the cellar, whose massive
slave masonry it was not possible to transport or reproduce.</p>
<p>This tavern bears the name of William Michie, son of the
John Michie of Louisa County who in 1746 bought a one
thousand, one hundred and fifty-two acre tract in that region
from John Henry of Hanover County, father of Patrick Henry.
John Michie made his home in this region in a great river
bend, and named it the Horse Shoe. His sons shared in the
development of the tract, and John Michie&rsquo;s will, 1777, provided
that each son should be confirmed in ownership of the
acres he had brought under cultivation, before equal distribution
of the remainder.</p>
<p>William Michie inherited in the Buck Mountain section,
lived there, and on November 11, 1784, petitioned the court
for &ldquo;License to keep ordinary in my house.&rdquo; William Michie
became a large landowner, served as Magistrate and Sheriff,
and died in 1811.</p>
<p>This old building displays an interesting exhibit of the
accustomed furnishings of that period.</p>

<p>Among the munificent gifts of Paul Goodloe McIntire to
his native town&mdash;parks, playgrounds, public library; gifts to
the University of Athletics, Fine Arts, Medicine, etc.&mdash;the
most obvious are the statues in the city.</p>
<h3 id="c27">LEWIS AND CLARK STATUE
<br /><i>Junction of West Main and Ridge Streets</i></h3>
<p>Sculptor, Charles Keck. Unveiled, November 21, 1919. This
work is of the romantic school. It is a three-figure group;
Meriwether Lewis, William Clark and Sacajawea, the young
Indian guide with her papoose. In beauty of design and of execution
it will repay prolonged scrutiny. The pedestal with its
carved symbolism should not be overlooked.</p>
<h3 id="c28">LOCATION OF STATUE</h3>
<p>Our present Main Street is the Colonial Three-chopt Road,
which led from Richmond, passed Boyd&rsquo;s Tavern and crossed
the Rivanna at Secretary&rsquo;s Ford&mdash;now the Woolen Mills (East
Market Street). Crossing Mechum&rsquo;s River it struck in a
straight line for Woods&rsquo; (now Jarman&rsquo;s) Gap. It was in use
prior to 1746. Though not associated with the expedition, it
was felt appropriate to place the explorers on a great early
artery and facing into the West.</p>
<h3 id="c29">MERIWETHER LEWIS</h3>
<p>Young Meriwether Lewis&mdash;he was only thirty-five at death&mdash;was
born in Albemarle in 1774. He was &lsquo;Albemarle of Albemarle.&rsquo;
The Lewis family was already old Virginia stock when
Robert Lewis took up large holdings in what is now this county.
He was Meriwether Lewis&rsquo;s grandfather. He owned the handsome
estate of Belvoir, near Cismont, and some ten thousand
acres in other parts of the county. Meriwether Lewis&rsquo;s mother
was a granddaughter of &lsquo;the great Landowner,&rsquo; Nicholas
Meriwether, who came up from tide-water where he owned
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
large estates, and in 1727 patented in one body 17,952 acres,
this being the first patent lying within the bounds of present
Albemarle. Eight years later he made an addition of more
than a thousand acres, adjoining, which became his home. He
was Lewis&rsquo;s great-grandfather. These were families of high
standards and public service&mdash;vestrymen, magistrates, officers
in the militia and the Revolution.</p>
<p>Our explorer&rsquo;s birthplace, Locust Grove, was west of Charlottesville
about seven miles. The name and site remain; the
original house was burned. The village of Ivy is near it.</p>
<p>Meriwether Lewis was Jefferson&rsquo;s secretary when the government
determined upon exploration of the lands just purchased
from France. He brilliantly headed this expedition&mdash;from
St. Louis to the mouth of the Columbia River, 1803-06.
Upon his return, Jefferson appointed him Territorial Governor
of Louisiana. In 1809, while journeying to Washington city,
he died by gunshot at an obscure country inn in Tennessee&mdash;whether
by his own hand or that of others was not definitely
known. A monument to him was erected at this spot by the
Legislature of Tennessee, 1848.</p>
<h3 id="c30">WILLIAM CLARK</h3>
<p>By a few years, William Clark, joint explorer of the Pacific
Coast, failed to be of Albemarle birth. Jonathan Clark of King
and Queen County, Virginia, in 1734 took out holdings in the
county. His dwelling was a plain house on the Stony Point
Road very near the site of Buena Vista, the McMurdo residence.
He had two famous grandsons; the elder, George Rogers
Clark, was born in that cabin. The younger, William, was born
in Caroline County where his father had inherited substantial
property. William Clark&rsquo;s later life was successful. He was
appointed by Jefferson Territorial Governor of Missouri, and
later became U. S. Agent for Indian Affairs. Died, 1838.</p>
<h3 id="c31">LOUISIANA PURCHASE.</h3>
<p>It is perhaps not always realized that Albemarle <i>was</i> the
Louisiana Purchase. Three of the actors in this great drama&mdash;Jefferson,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
Lewis and Monroe&mdash;lived here within a ten-mile
radius. A circle with that diameter would include Monticello,
Ash Lawn and Locust Hill. As members of a small and closely
integrated social class these men knew each other intimately
in private life. Despite the difference in age, Jefferson and
Lewis had attended the same private classical school; Monroe
had at one time studied law under Jefferson&rsquo;s supervision.</p>
<p>Monroe came to Albemarle in 1789 and made it his home
until his retirement from public life. His choice of home was
dictated by his oft-expressed desire to be near Jefferson, their
friendship being early formed and life-long. Thus, when this
chance to acquire a vast territory arose, the men who handled
it knew fully the respective qualities of each actor.</p>
<h3 id="c32">STONEWALL JACKSON STATUE
<br /><i>Jackson Park. East Jefferson Street</i>
<br /><i>Adjoining Court House</i></h3>
<p>Sculptor, Charles Keck. Unveiled, October 19, 1921. This
dynamic equestrian figure, of the romantic school, already ranks
among the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;great action&rdquo; sculptures. It is known that the
artist, at its inception, came to Albemarle to study Virginia-bred
horses and the Virginia seat in the saddle. A local horse-fancier
demonstrated these points. The beautiful pedestal is
enfolded in the superb wing-sweep of two symbolic forms&mdash;Faith
and Valor.</p>
<p>Thomas Jonathan Jackson&mdash;Virginian by birth, graduate
of West Point, distinguished in the Mexican War&mdash;resigned
from the regular army, 1851, and became a Presbyterian elder
and a professor of natural philosophy and artillery tactics at
the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington. Ten years later,
at the outbreak of the War-between-the-States, he entered the
Confederate army and rose to a rank second in authority only
to Lee. His military genius was fully recognized abroad, and
his campaigns have long been studied in England&rsquo;s military
schools. General Jackson was killed, 1863, at the battle of
Chancellorsville through the blunder of his own men. His age
was thirty-nine.</p>

<h3 id="c33">GEORGE ROGERS CLARK STATUE
<br /><i>West Main Street near Twelfth</i></h3>
<p>Sculptor, Robert Ingersol Aitkin. Unveiled, January 6th,
1922. This seven-figure group portrays the mounted Conqueror
of the North West in conference with a standing Indian chief,
who shares the central focus. Their attendants complete the
vital and finely balanced conception. A surrounding planting
of pine suggests a forest atmosphere.</p>
<p>This frontier military leader was born in Albemarle
County, 1752, on the Stony Point Road. His family removed to
Caroline County when he was five years of age, and he early
migrated to Kentucky. Upon the coming on of the Revolution
he threw himself ardently into the protection of the exposed
northwestern regions. At Williamsburg he presented their
dangers to the Assembly and obtained a military commission
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
for their defense against British and Indian forces. He was
in chief command and rose to Brig. General. During this
period, 1778-1783, he was a popular idol and was called &ldquo;the
George Washington of the West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His later life was tragically darkened by debts contracted
for the necessities of his men and never made good by Virginia.
Political intrigue and calumny added to his misfortunes.
He died in poverty and neglect near Louisville, Kentucky, 1818.</p>
<h3 id="c34">LEE STATUE
<br /><i>Lee Park. East Jefferson and N. 2nd Streets</i>
<br /><i>Opposite Charlottesville Library</i></h3>
<p>Sculptor, Leo Lentelli. Unveiled, May 21, 1924. This equestrian
figure of Lee is in monument style. The block which it
occupies was from 1929 the Southall-Venable home.</p>

<p class="cap">Miniature Model of Lee. 1937. <span class="hst"><i>J. Rawlings Thomson</i></span></p></div>
<p>Robert Edward Lee was born, 1807, at Stratford, Virginia,
of distinguished ancestry. The family&rsquo;s founder came to Virginia
in the reign of Charles I, and became the colony&rsquo;s Secretary
of State and a member of the privy Council of Virginia.</p>
<p>A graduate of West Point (later its Superintendent), and
distinguished in the Mexican War, Lee had resigned from
active service when Lincoln offered him command of the Federal
forces in the field. With a heavy heart he declined. (He
had earlier freed his slaves.) Writing on the eve of the crisis,
he said &ldquo;&mdash;I can anticipate no greater calamity for the country
than the dissolution of the Union.... Still a Union that
can only be maintained by swords and bayonets ... has no
charms for me. If the Union is dissolved and the Government
dispersed, I shall return to my native State and share the
miseries of my people, and, save in defense, will draw my
sword no more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>After the war, Lee set himself to heal the wounds of his
people. He refused public office and became President of Washington
College (now Washington and Lee) in Lexington.
Died, 1870.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lee&rsquo;s high character, his moral courage, his noble nature,
and his mastery of the art of war, make him a notable figure
in history.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c35">MINIATURE MODEL OF LEE
<br /><i>Charlottesville Library</i>
<br /><i>N. 2nd and East Jefferson Streets</i></h3>
<p>Sculptor, Henry M. Shrady. Presented by the Honourable
and Mrs. Alexander Wilbourne Weddell through the Richmond
Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. 1937.
This charming equestrian figure of the Confederate General,
by Shrady, was executed as the first step in a heroic statue
commissioned by Mr. McIntire. The sculptor&rsquo;s sudden death
prevented the fulfillment of this contract, but Charlottesville
is fortunate in owning this model of the artist&rsquo;s noble conception.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h3 id="c36">ENVOI</h3>
<p>In the 1870&rsquo;s the town&rsquo;s postmaster lay in his final illness.
In the manner of the day a friend sat beside his bed and extolled
the blessedness of heaven. The old gentleman assented
quietly, adding, &ldquo;but I believe I should prefer to compromise
and remain in Charlottesville.&rdquo;</p>
